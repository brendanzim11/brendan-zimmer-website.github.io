				<h2> Welcome to my Website</h2>
				<p> The goal of this website is to give information on bars that include the deals, merch, events and anything that can be publicly known about the bar.  All the information on bars will be conglomerated into one spot.  Not only this but we will have public rankings of each bar per week along with special deals.</p>

			<h2> New to Madison</h2>
			<p> If you are new to Madison look at the top bars, about and deals tab.  These will give you most information on the bars such as: where they are located, deals, busy hours and more.  Please feel free to look around the rest of the site too.</p>

			<h2> Top Bars </h2>
			<p> The top bars in Madison will be decided on by the people visiting the website.  Instead of using reviews of the bars already made we will ask our visitors to rank the bars on their opinon.  This will allow for a harsher rating, but also the people will be involved.</p>

			<h2> Events and Deals </h2>
			<p> With so many bars in Madison, it is hard to keep track of all the events and deals that are going on throughout the week.  Instead we have it placed in a convienent spot in the Deals and Events section.  It would be recommended to visit these for on going and upcoming events and deals. </p>
